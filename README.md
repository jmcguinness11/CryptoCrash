# CryptoCrash
Application that notifies user via text message when big changes in Bitcoin happen.

## Dependencies
 - smtplib
 - bitcoin-price-api	(https://github.com/dursk/bitcoin-price-api)[Github link)
 
## Notes
For now, any user will have to create their own *variables.py* file to define
necessary variables.  In the future, I will make the application more interactive.
